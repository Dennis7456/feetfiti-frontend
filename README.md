# Title: Online Shoe Store

## Description:

Our Online Shoe Store is a React-based e-commerce application that allows customers to browse and purchase shoes online. The frontend of the application is designed with Chakra UI, a component library that provides a set of accessible and customizable UI components, making it easier to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

The application provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows customers to search and filter shoes by brand, color, size, and price, and view details about each shoe, such as product descriptions, images, and availability. Customers can also add items to their shopping cart, checkout securely using a payment gateway, and track the status of their orders.

In addition, the application provides a login system that allows customers to create and manage their accounts, view their order history, and save their shipping and billing information for future purchases.

For promoters, the application provides a unique referral link that they can share with customers, allowing them to earn a commission on sales generated through their link. The application also includes a dashboard that allows promoters to view their commission earnings and track the performance of their referral links.

To ensure the quality and reliability of the application, we have implemented a pipeline of automated tests and linting tools that check the code for errors and ensure that it meets industry standards. We have also integrated a logging service that tracks errors and exceptions and provides insights into the application's performance.

With our Online Shoe Store, we aim to provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for customers while also offering an opportunity for promoters to earn additional income.
